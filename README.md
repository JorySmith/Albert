## About
Struggling to solve problems holds us back a great deal at work and at home. If we can't solve a problem, it can lead to great pain and terrible consequences. I feel I'm not living up to my potential and I don't think I'm alone in feeling that way.

Now that first paragraph sounds reasonable but it's not the full truth. Therefore, it's a lie. As a longtime alcoholic, my first intuition is to lie but as a recovering alcoholic now, my intuition is to catch myself lying and correct the lie as soon as possible with the truth.

The truth is I created this website because I destroyed nearly everything in my life. It's in this hell that I realized I had a choice, a choice to either stop running away from my problems and starting bringing light into this world or continue on the path to destruction and armageddon.

My mission now is to stop running away from my problems and try to repay the debt I've incurred to my friends, family, and community. I figured one way I could achieve that was by creating a website that captures everything I've learned in the military and in school that I didn't apply myself. A website with every skill critical to running toward problems and danger, solving them with speed and grace, and bringing light into a world that seems quite dark at times. A website that anyone can use, anywhere, anytime.
