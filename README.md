# Albert
A problem solving process and algorithm inspired by Albert Einstein:

 "If I had an hour to solve a problem, I'd spend 55 minutes thinking about the problem and 5 minutes thinking about solutions."

 "Try not to become a man of success. Rather become a man of value."

 ## Why Create this App?
 I feel I'm nowhere near living up to my potential as a problem solver and I don't think I'm alone in that feeling. Not performing at our best at solving problems holds us back a great deal at work, and at home.
 
 I also feel really frustrated that I can't remember all of the fundamentals, tips, and tricks I've learned over the years. So I set out to create an online solution that I can use anywhere, anytime.
