## About
Struggling to solve problems thrown our way holds us back a great deal at work and at home. I feel I'm not living up to my potential and I don't think I'm alone in feeling that way.
 
I also feel really frustrated that I can't remember all the fundamentals, tips, and tricks I've learned over the years. There are just too many things to remember, especially when the stakes are high or I'm simply just tired.
 
However, getting better at solving problems can make us incredibly valuable, not just to our companies and ourselves, but to our families and communities. So I set out to create an online solution that can be used by anyone, anywhere, anytime.
