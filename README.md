Problem Solving from First Principles. 

"If I had an hour to solve a problem, I'd spend 55 minutes thinking about the problem and 5 minutes thinking about solutions." - Albert Einstein

Running away from problems is the greatest problem in the world. <br>
Try running toward problems and facing fears. <br>
The solutions are found within.
