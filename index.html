                  Running away from Problems is the greatest Problem in the
                  world. Ignoring Problems only makes them grow much bigger and
                  more dangerous with time. Solutions are found within the
                  Problem they solve. Try becoming antifragile by learning,
                  growing, and thriving from your Problems and Fears. Try to
                  visit but not remain in the Darkness (Problems) to find the
                  Answers (Solutions) you seek. Especially the scariest Problems
                  that undoubtedly contain the Solutions that will help you grow
                  stronger, wiser, and more resilient.

                  Try avoiding the consequences of purposeless nihilism, which
                  is pure hell, and hell is a bottomless pit. Nobody's perfect, but try taking responsibility
                  for your life and try to be a better person. Having a good Aim
                  literally changes your reality and vision. An Aim reveals what
                  you actually see in the world. An Aim reveals the righteous
                  path you've chosen and the Problems and Obstacles in your way.
                  If you're not growing, you're dying.

                  You will not believe how much of your voice is locked away in
                  a prison, handcuffed, and silenced. That is until you try
                  this. Thoughts, worries, frustrations, fears, problems, goals,
                  etc. Anything and everything you can think of. Writing
                  supercharges clarity and problem solving skills. It also frees
                  your soul and liberates the value you can bring to the world.
                  Also, consider sharing it, teaching it, and sharpening it.

                  Stuck? Panicking? Feel like giving up? The Goal, Problem, or Solution is probably
                  too big or takes too long to accomplish, which can lead to giving up way too
                  early. Try breaking them down into smaller ones or shorter
                  time frames to tackle and conquer. Build momentum and
                  countless incremental gains, progress, and victories. Progress
                  over perfection. You can always make improvements later as you
                  iterate.

                  divergent thinking in your mind. Do something else, think
                  about something else, go for a walk, or leave and come back.

                Goals to avoid Fears are <u>100-200%</u> more effective at

              <p>
                Struggling to solve problems thrown our way holds us back a
                great deal at work and at home. I feel I'm not living up to my
                potential and I don't think I'm alone in feeling that way.
              </p>
              <p>
                I also feel really frustrated that I can't remember all the
                fundamentals, tips, and tricks I've learned over the years.
                There are just too many things to remember, especially when the
                stakes are high or I'm simply just tired.
              </p>
              <p>
                However, getting better at solving problems can make us
                incredibly valuable, not just to our companies and ourselves,
                but to our families and communities. So I set out to create an
                online solution that can be used by anyone, anywhere, anytime.
