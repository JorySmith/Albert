                  Running away from Problems is the greatest Problem in the
                  world, which is understandable because it takes true courage
                  to willingly walk toward and take on danger. However, ignoring
                  Problems only makes them grow bigger and more dangerous with
                  time. Solutions are found within the Problem they solve. Try
                  becoming antifragile by learning, growing, and thriving from
                  your Problems and Fears. Try to visit but not remain in the
                  Darkness (Problems) to find the Answers (Solutions) you seek.
                  Especially the scariest Problems that undoubtedly contain the
                  Solutions that will help you grow stronger, wiser, and more
                  resilient.

                  Try avoiding the consequences of purposeless nihilism, which
                  is pure hell, and hell is a bottomless pit. In the end, when
                  you look back on your life, how would you feel about it? Would
                  you be able to admire and love yourself? Nobody's perfect, but
                  try taking responsibility for your life and try to be a better
                  person. Having a good Aim literally changes your reality and
                  vision. An Aim reveals what you actually see in the world. An
                  Aim reveals the righteous path you've chosen and the Problems
                  and Obstacles in your way. If you're not growing, you're
                  dying.

                  will imprison you while the truth will set you free. Try
                  telling and trusting only the Truth. That can be very
                  difficult so try not telling and trusting Lies. Watch it lead
                  toward inner peace and greatness.

                  You will not believe how much of your voice is silenced,
                  handcuffed, and locked away in a prison. That is until you try
                  this. Try writing for five minutes about thoughts, worries,
                  frustrations, fears, problems, goals, etc. Anything and
                  everything you can think of. Writing supercharges clarity, memory, and
                  problem solving skills. It also frees your soul and liberates
                  the value you can bring to the world. Also, consider sharing
                  it, teaching it, and sharpening it.

                  Stuck? Emotional? Losing hope and feel like giving up? You
                  probably haven't written down the Problem, Goal, or Solution.
                  It's also probably too big or takes too long to accomplish or
                  overcome, which can lead to giving up way too early. Take a
                  break and try breaking it down into smaller steps or shorter
                  time frames to tackle and conquer. Build momentum and
                  countless incremental gains, progress, and victories. Grow
                  your victory resume. You can always make improvements later as
                  you iterate. Progress over perfection.

                  You don't have to struggle alone. Two minds are better than
                  one. Also, most Problems have already been solved. You need
                  only search for their Solutions or ask for help. In fact, one
                  of the fastest ways to find the correct Solution is to share
                  the wrong Solution publicly (or at least your guess), and
                  watch as the community feels compelled to correct the error
                  immediately and without hesitation, which is Cunningham's Law.

                  Try to avoid inviting suffering into your life by losing track of
                  the critical things you need to do to achieve your Goals and
                  live your Values. Try creating to-do lists and timelines as
                  well as setting reminders and deadlines. Deadlines help you
                  avoid overworking and analysis paralysis. Deadlines also turn
                  infinite suffering into finite frustrations.

                  >
                  Try to avoid restricting your options at the beginning of any venture because it will only limit your capabilities and degrade overall performance. Try considering many options initially to maximize the chances of choosing the best direction and most effective action. Assume Murphy's Law will prevail and that anything that can go wrong, will go wrong. Try Brainstorming future problems to solve now before they plague you and your team later. While Brainstorming, no idea is bad. Try to express your deepest Curiosity and
                  Creativity. Leave judgment at your door. Try writing down as
                  many ideas, possibilities, options, and alternatives as
                  possible. Quantity over quality.

                  Try to avoid wasting time on things that don't matter. Some things
                  are far more important and impactful than other things, also
                  known as the 80/20 Principle, which is derived from the Pareto
                  Principle. Quality over quantity. Try narrowing your focus and attention by filtering, reducing, and prioritizing the most important things. Also, emotions and feelings
                  can reveal what truly matters to you. Try exploring them.

                  Stubbornly fighting a problem despite seeing very little
                  progress or results is the definition of insanity and isn't good for anyone. You won't believe
                  how fast solutions pop up if you take a break. Try activating
                  divergent thinking in your mind. Do something else, think
                  about something else, go for a walk, or leave and come back.

                  Explanations are the least effective form of communication.
                  From debates to teaching, a far better option is to provide
                  specific Examples, Stories, or Demonstrations because they
                  contain incredible detail, usefulness, and persuasiveness. A single picture is worth a thousand words. Try
                  seeking mentors and role models, which are living
                  Demonstrations of excellence in your eyes. Try letting your
                  walking do the talking. Show, don't tell.

                  The opposite of Gratitude is ungratefulness and resentment,
                  and resentment is one of the foundational elements of evil.
                  Ungratefulness and resentment hide all of the opportunities
                  standing right in front of you, regardless of the situation.
                  Try being Grateful for your current situation. Gratefulness
                  will enhance your vision and reveal the path toward Hope of a
                  better today, and tomorrow. We can either say "Thank you" or
                  "Goodbye."

                  also hold within us a very unique life and distinct
                  perspective only we can speak for. To ignore our uniqueness is
                  to argue we have no differences, no individuality, and no soul

                Values and Fears are two sides of the same coin.
                <br />
                Identify a Value (Strength, Wisdom) and you immediately know the
                associated Fear (Weakness, Stupidity), and vice versa. <br />
                Identify a Value or Fear, ask, "Why this Value/Fear?" Keep
                asking and answering for five times and you'll typically arrive
                at a truly Core Value or Fear.<br />
                Probably the most important Values and Fears are the ones you're
                hiding and ignoring because they contain the greatest insights
                into your true character.

                Goals are also Solutions to Problems.<br />
                Goals reveal their Solutions and Problems.<br />

                There are two types of Goals: 1) Achieve/Get something of Value,
                2) Avoid a Fear. <br />
                Goals to avoid Fears are <u>100-200%</u> more effective at
                driving behavior than Goals to achieve Values.
                <br />
                Try combining them: Get in better shape and Avoid being fat.<br />
                Can you feel the difference? It sure isn't fun to hear but we
                can either take the less painful way toward our Values, or the
                more effective way.<br />
                Progress over perfection.<br />
                Not making progress toward at least one of our Goals
                significantly contributes to feelings of depression and
                anxiety.<br />
                We innately need to feel progress toward our Goals or our body
                will start to fire the alarm bells to try to get us back on
                track to living our Values.<br />
                It's the journey that matters most, not the destination.

                Struggling to solve problems thrown our way holds us back a
                great deal at work and at home. I feel I'm not living up to my

                Now that first paragraph sounds reasonable but it's not the full
                truth. Therefore, it's a lie. As an alcoholic, my first
                intuition is to lie. But as a recovering alcoholic now, my
                intuition is to catch myself lying and correct it as soon as
                possible with the truth.

                The truth is I created this website because I destroyed nearly
                everything in my life. It's in this hell that I realized I had a
                choice. I had a choice to stop bringing hell into this world and
                try to redeem myself.
              </p>
              <p>
                My mission now is to repay my debt. I figured I could achieve
                that by creating a website that captures the most important
                skills to solving the hardest problems in the world, especially
                addiction. A site that anyone can use, anywhere, anytime.
