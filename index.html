                <br />
                However, most things in life should be assumed to be false and
                therefore tested in the real world. <br />
                Mother Nature, people's actions, free markets, and your higher
                power are the ultimate judges of truth.
                <br />
                Even if these principles are true and helpful, they are still
                perfect ideals and nobody's perfect.
                <br />
                No mortal human being can claim perfect adherence to these
                principles.
                <br />
                Regardless, it's better to stumble forward in the right
                direction than stand still chasing perfection. You can always
                make improvements as you iterate.
                <br />
                Progress over perfection.

                  <p>
                    Running away from problems is the greatest problem in the
                    world, which is understandable because it takes true courage
                    to willingly face and take on danger. However, ignoring
                    problems only makes them grow bigger and more dangerous with
                    time. The only way to overcome evil is to recognize that it
                    exists. For only then are you no longer blind and able to
                    see it, challenge it, and conquer it. The least righteous
                    person says they are good. They are blind to their evil. The
                    most righteous person says they strive to be good, but are
                    capable of evil. And they seek to remedy it.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Solutions are found within the problem they solve. And since
                    Light — i.e., attention — is the best disinfectant, try
                    shining it on problems. Try becoming antifragile by
                    learning, growing, and thriving from your problems and
                    fears. Willingly facing your problems and fears is the first
                    chapter in the book of Courage. But be careful of focusing
                    on obvious problems because they're probably symptoms of
                    much deeper and more important problems that need solving.
                    You don't have to dig very deep to find something truly
                    tragic in anyone's life. And it's these deep problems and
                    pains that contain much more impactful solutions and
                    insights.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Try visiting but not remaining in the darkness to find the
                    answers you seek. Especially the scariest problems that
                    undoubtedly contain some serious pain and discomfort but
                    also the most powerful solutions that can help you grow
                    stronger, wiser, and more resilient. And while it's
                    important to visit the Darkness, such as feeling emotions
                    like sadness and grief in order to truly heal, it's also
                    important to not get stuck there and carried out into the
                    ocean of despair and hopelessness. So try not to forget to
                    Visit the Darkness, find the Light, and then get the hell
                    out of there to save yourself and the people around you.

                    Try to avoid the consequences of purposeless nihilism and
                    chaotic aimlessness, which are pure hell, and hell is a
                    bottomless pit of problems. Without divine purpose, values,
                    and an aim for the highest good, we see no path toward
                    glory, which mutates nearly everything in our lives into a
                    problem or pain. To miss what you're aiming at is called
                    sin. And to sin is not the worst thing in the world. Worse
                    than sin is the

                      >denial of sin</a
                    >. For if you deny your sins, how can you ever reach your
                    highest aim or be forgiven for missing it in the first
                    place? To live blinded by the denial of sin and without
                    forgiveness is to create hell and suffering all around you,
                    and within you. In the end, when you look back on your life,
                    how would you feel about it? Would you be able to admire and
                    love yourself?

                    Everything you do matters. Why? Because everything you do —
                    positive or negative — is contagious to all of the people
                    around you. Any failure to spread good in the world will
                    haunt you, and the people around you, including your
                    descendants because they're watching and learning your
                    behavior and habits. Your actions will absolutely echo in
                    eternity. So is your attitude or ethos worth catching? If
                    not, try making a change. Nobody's perfect, but try taking
                    responsibility for your life. Try being a better person
                    today than you were yesterday. Are you living in service of
                    others or in selfish slavery to yourself? Who are you
                    accountable to? Try to imagine that every encounter you have
                    is being filmed and will surely end up on social media, or
                    worse, national news channels. The odds of this happening
                    are not decreasing, they're increasing daily. So try to
                    think twice before acting because the consequences could be
                    dire.

                  <p>
                    Having a good aim literally changes your reality and vision.
                    Without an aim, we are blind. With an aim, we can see. I
                    aim, therefore I see. Quaero, ergo video. This is why
                    setting goals and choosing values are absolutely critical to
                    problem solving. The magical benefits of aiming for
                    something are also why prayer is a foundational feature of
                    many religious traditions. An aim reveals the righteous path
                    you've chosen and the problems and obstacles in your way.
                    And if you try aiming for the highest good, watch as the
                    universe conspires to help you in every possible way.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    If you stumble and fail at an obstacle on your path, try to
                    avoid beating yourself up for it because it'll just create
                    five more problems and obstacles in your way. We can either
                    behave with a loser mindset, or a learner mindset. Only one
                    of those options unlocks unlimited potential. It's better to
                    stumble forward in the right direction than stand still
                    chasing perfection. Progress over perfection. In addition,
                    every obstacle or failure is an opportunity for true
                    alchemy. Try converting each obstacle and failure into a
                    victory by learning from it, fixing it, and growing from it.
                    And the next time you stumble and fail, remember to get back
                    up, dust yourself off, get back on track, and move forward.
                    Don't give up. Keep going. If you're not moving forward and
                    growing, you're dying.

                  <p>
                    Telling lies and trusting lies are a one-way ticket to
                    misery and hell. Lies may not take you to hell immediately,
                    but the destination is certain. It's when, not if. Lies will
                    imprison you, while the truth will set you free. Lies erode
                    trust in relationships and trust is the foundation of all
                    healthy, strong, and deep relationships. People's words
                    don't reveal the truth, their actions do. Words make real,
                    but Actions make true. Actions reveal character, not words.
                    Your higher power listens to your words, but judges you by
                    your actions. Try paying attention to people's actions. The
                    Truth and the Highest Good are the ultimate flaming swords.
                    Now imagine wielding both.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Arrogance, ego, and excessive pride precede many downfalls.
                    Why? Because these traits generally indicate someone has
                    become complacent and abandoned the truth. This person
                    probably has a narcissistic conviction that he or she knows
                    the truth above anyone else or reality itself, which is a
                    lie. Wisdom is humbling while arrogance is stupidity. So try
                    showing humility and gratitude because they are potent
                    antidotes to the toxic and intoxicating feelings of
                    arrogance, ego, and excessive pride that destroy the weak,
                    and the strong.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Try telling the truth and only trusting the truth. That can
                    be very difficult because the truth can be quite painful.
                    And truth delivered without care can be cruel. So try not
                    telling lies and not trusting lies. Watch as it leads toward
                    inner peace and greatness.

                    You will not believe how much of your voice is silenced,
                    handcuffed, and locked away in a prison. That is until you
                    try writing for five minutes about your thoughts, worries,
                    frustrations, fears, problems, goals, etc. Anything and
                    everything you can think of. Try writing about the
                    activities where you experience the most meaning. Try
                    writing about what you do to have fun. Try writing about
                    what you want. What do you stand for? What adventure would
                    you like to go on? What dreams and fears get you really
                    fired up and motivated? Just try to get your thoughts out of
                    your mind and onto paper, or talk about them with someone
                    you trust, which may include an AI chatbot if no one is
                    around at the moment.

                    Writing and talking about anything supercharge clarity,
                    memory, and problem solving skills. Writing and talking
                    bring ephemeral thoughts and abstract ideas into the real
                    world so you can face them. Words make real. Once you can
                    face thoughts and ideas, you can understand, learn, and grow
                    from them. Writing and talking also free your soul and
                    liberate the value you can bring to the world. Consider
                    sharing, teaching, and sharpening what you've discovered on
                    your writing and talking journey.

                    The foundational goal of mental health therapeutic problem
                    solving is self-awareness through self-exploration,
                    expression, and understanding. Self-awareness necessitates
                    that we write and talk deeply about what we've discovered on
                    our self-exploration journey. Try bringing your unconscious
                    mind into the world through writing and talking to reveal
                    its secrets, tragedies, and treasures. This might sound
                    scary and dangerous, so it will require true courage to
                    willingly do it. But, you just might discover a few
                    surprising life-changing miracles.

                    Feeling lost, unmotivated, emotional, or just wanting to
                    give up? You might be trying to focus on a problem or goal
                    that's too big, move too fast, brute force a solution that's
                    not working, or compare your Chapter 2 progress to someone
                    else's Chapter 20, all of which can be incredibly
                    demoralizing. You may be forgetting to reduce the friction
                    between you and showing up to start progress, such as
                    forgetting to lay out gym clothes the night before a gym
                    session. You might not have clearly defined and deeply
                    developed your problem or goal in writing, which can make it
                    really difficult to understand and tackle effectively. All
                    of these actions can insidiously implant the feeling that
                    showing up and taking the first step, or just the next step,
                    look way too daunting. So we give up.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Remember, simply showing up is half the battle. In addition,
                    each step you take, whether it's the first, 20th, or last,
                    is a decisive victory and clear proof you can do this. The
                    first step and last step are usually the hardest steps to
                    take. But if you can create the conditions that help you
                    show up, you are already halfway to your goal. Then all you
                    need to do is focus on taking that next step, however small,
                    or however slow. Find the low-hanging fruit and crush them
                    to build victory momentum. Try crawling first, then walking,
                    and then running. Try taking that next step of victory to
                    prove you can definitely do this, and nothing is going to
                    stop you. Compounding these small victories over time will
                    give you the strongest chance of achieving your goals and
                    living your values. Chip away every day.

                    It's also important to remember we all suck when we start
                    something new. We all face failure and a ton of mistakes,
                    especially at the beginning of any effort, and especially
                    champions because they see mistakes more clearly and feel
                    them more intensely than most. However, the beginning is
                    like the surf zone of a beach, with chaotic and challenging
                    waves. If you're trying to get out to sea, the hardest part
                    is the beginning, which is pushing through these wild waves.
                    Once you escape the beginning surf zone though, the seas
                    generally calm and the journey becomes easier.

                    Our habits transform us into the people we are. Consistency
                    is King. So try developing the habit of taking a break to
                    better understand the problem you're trying to solve or the
                    goal you're trying to achieve. What exactly is the problem
                    or goal? Try developing the habit of showing up to start
                    your journey. Try developing the habit of focusing on how
                    far you've come, instead of how far you still need to go.
                    Try developing the habit of taking one more step in the
                    right direction. Try developing the habit of getting back up
                    after falling, and moving forward wiser and stronger. Try
                    developing the habit of taking bad options off the table for
                    discussion, like quitting or harmful behaviors. Try
                    developing the habit of asking yourself, "How do I break
                    down this big, tough problem/goal into smaller, easier
                    ones?" Try developing the habit of setting shorter timeframe
                    goals to help you accomplish those crucial initial victories
                    or maintain your current victory momentum. You just have to
                    do what's right, right now in this crucial moment. Then chip
                    away every day.

                    Making progress is the key to building abundant
                    self-confidence and self-respect. What's the opposite of
                    progress? Regression and idleness. And what do they say
                    about idle hands? A certain someone's playground? Not good.
                    So be honest with yourself and ask, "What small step am I
                    actually willing to take right now?" Identify this critical
                    small step and then aim for it. Show up to start your
                    journey or get back on the victory path. Watch as your small
                    victories build momentum, grow your victory resume, and
                    ultimately solidify your confidence and conviction. Imagine
                    how you'll feel if you're victorious. Imagine how you'll
                    feel if you fail to start or keep going and let down the
                    people you care about most. Imagine proving your doubters
                    and haters right instead of your loved ones. You can always
                    make improvements as you iterate. Progress over perfection.

                    You don't have to struggle alone. Life is not a closed book
                    test and two minds are better than one. Also, most problems
                    have already been solved, you need only search for their
                    solutions or ask for help. So try to avoid reinventing the
                    wheel and remember, asking questions and listening can
                    become some of your most powerful problem solving tools.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It can feel scary to ask for help. It can feel like you're
                    exposing yourself as someone who doesn't know what they're
                    doing. However, nobody knows everything and champions rarely
                    rely on just themselves. Changing your environment, such as
                    the people around you and the content you consume, can make
                    all the difference between success and failure. We also know
                    it usually feels better to give than it is to receive. So
                    try to avoid robbing people of their chance to help you,
                    especially the people you lead. We all want to feel
                    impactful and contribute to the mission. Try enabling that
                    by asking for help when you need it.

                    One of the fastest ways to find the correct solution is to
                    share the wrong solution publicly — or at least your guess —
                    and watch as the community feels compelled to correct the
                    error immediately and without hesitation, which is
                    Cunningham's Law.

                    If you want to move slower, undermine outcomes, and degrade
                    relationships, then bossing people around, including bossing
                    yourself around, is a great strategy. Little freedom, low
                    productivity. Being bossed around can make us quite
                    undisciplined and really hurt, and hurt people tend to hurt
                    people, especially themselves. And for many of us, the
                    person who hurt us the most in our lives, was ourselves.

                    We are all in the hospitality business, especially leaders.
                    Try involving others, collaborating, and enjoying the power
                    of community, agency, and shared causes. Try to avoid
                    forcing your opinions, solutions, and conclusions on other
                    people unless you want to grow a seed of misery into a tree
                    of resentment. The focus is less about giving people
                    solutions and more about working together to find them. Two
                    minds are better than one.

                  <p>
                    Try giving the evidence instead of your conclusion. Try
                    replacing your conclusions and judgments with curiosity and
                    collaboration by converting them into a question. For
                    example, instead of saying, "I really don't think John is
                    performing up to standards," which is you forcing a
                    conclusion on someone else without evidence, try providing a
                    piece of evidence and posing a question, "John has been
                    struggling to meet important deadlines. What are your
                    thoughts on his performance lately?" Now you're
                    collaborating instead of dictating. Try being a collaborator
                    over a dictator. Ask, don't order, or at least have the
                    respect to provide the context and reasoning to support the
                    order. Try asking questions, listening, and reading tone and
                    body language to understand before talking to be understood.

                    >8) Develop a Process. Create Habits. Look for Triggers
                    Around You to Spark Action.</span
                  >
                  <br />
                  <p>
                    Wisdom is meaningless and powerless without consistent
                    Actions and Habits. A process, system, framework, or routine
                    can help trigger those actions and habits that apply all of
                    the knowledge and skills you've acquired. Like an alarm
                    clock, Triggers are clear reminders in the world to take
                    action. Trigger > Action. Triggers fall into three
                    categories: Time, Event, or Visual Cue. For example, a time
                    trigger would be something like: 6:30 AM (Trigger) > Wake up
                    and drink a glass of water (Action). An event trigger would
                    be something like: After breakfast (Trigger) > Brush teeth
                    (Action). Actions are preplanned habits to be executed
                    immediately and without hesitation after a Trigger has been
                    identified in the real world. No thinking allowed, only
                    action because thinking destroys actions and habits. For
                    example, pilots use pre-flight checklists no matter how many
                    thousands of hours of experience they may have. Losing track
                    of even one thing can be the difference between life and
                    death.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    So try creating a process that removes thinking and
                    incorporates triggers and checklists to automate the actions
                    that help you achieve your goals and live your values. Your
                    request to think after a trigger is identified in the real
                    world is denied, and with extreme prejudice. You'll have
                    plenty of time to think and negotiate with yourself during
                    planning and preparation. And if you've done your planning
                    and preparation, you'll know exactly what action to take —
                    and when — for maximum gain.

                  <p>
                    A chaotic and disorganized mind is a chaotic and
                    disorganized life. In this overwhelmingly complex modern
                    age, we have to sift through truly astronomical amounts of
                    information our brains have simply never dealt with before
                    in human history. But what we can do is try focusing on what
                    we can control, which is organizing and structuring what we
                    read, hear, and think. We can try bringing order to the
                    chaos. Order can make it much easier for us to find deep
                    insights and profound breakthroughs. So try creating sorted
                    lists, categories, groups, and chunks of information to make
                    it easier to understand, remember, and convert into wisdom.

                    Many of us are dealing with — or are unaware of — many
                    limiting beliefs that hold us back from unleashing our
                    potential, achieving our goals, and living our values. The
                    stories we tell ourselves and the identity we subscribe to
                    are big drivers of our actions and habits, good or bad. So
                    try exploring your beliefs, identity, and the stories you
                    tell yourself. Try eliminating the unhelpful to make way for
                    the powerful. Try discovering new beliefs, new stories, and
                    a new identity to get you back on track toward achieving
                    your goals and living your values.

                  <p>
                    Try to avoid inviting suffering into your life by losing
                    track of the critical things you need to do to achieve your
                    goals and live your values. Try creating schedules, to-do
                    lists, to-don't lists, and timelines as well as setting
                    reminders and deadlines. Setting timelines and deadlines can
                    morph what looks like a daunting task into a trivial one.
                    Try scheduling something to look forward to like a night out
                    on the town, a vacation, a social gathering, or even a
                    delicious dinner and movie night or game night. Watch it
                    generate energy, hope, and optimism. Deadlines help you
                    avoid overworking, overthinking, and analysis paralysis.
                    Deadlines also provide a welcome finish line and turn what
                    feels like infinite suffering into finite frustrations.

                    Try to avoid restricting your options at the beginning of
                    any venture because it will only limit your possibilities,
                    degrade performance, and may send you down the wrong path.
                    The opportunity cost of going down the wrong path can be
                    quite costly. Try considering many options initially to
                    maximize the chances of choosing the best direction and most
                    effective action. Measure twice. Cut once.

                    While Brainstorming, no idea is bad. Leave judgment at your
                    door because it's quite destructive to brainstorming. Try to
                    express your deepest Curiosity and Creativity. Try writing
                    down as many ideas, possibilities, options, and alternatives
                    as possible. Think Breadth first, then Depth. Quantity over
                    quality.

                    If you're struggling to remember something, say a movie
                    title, one rapid way to remember it is to think of and say
                    as many ideas that are closely related to that movie as you
                    can. Let's try: 1) Vote for Pedro. 2) Your mom goes to
                    college. 3) Uncle Rico. 4) Gosh! Need more help? Probably

                    go wrong, will go wrong. Then try doing a premortem, i.e.,
                    brainstorming future consequences and problems to solve now
                    before they plague you and your team later.

                    Try to avoid wasting time on things that don't matter. Try
                    to avoid being penny smart, dollar stupid. Some things are
                    far more important and impactful than other things, also
                    known as the 80/20 Principle, which is derived from the
                    Pareto Principle. Quality over quantity. Try narrowing your
                    focus and attention on the things that matter by filtering,
                    reducing, and setting aside the noise. Less is more. Also,
                    emotions and feelings can reveal what truly matters to you.
                    Try exploring them.

                    Burning out or stubbornly fighting a problem despite seeing
                    very little to no progress can be quite toxic mentally.
                    Overflowing frustrations and exhaustion aren't good for
                    anyone, and can lead some people to turn to harmful
                    behaviors — such as addictions — in order to escape the
                    misery. Try to notice when you're burning out, getting
                    really tired, or being overstimulated so you can take a
                    crucial break before catastrophe strikes. Even better, try
                    taking precautions to avoid burnout like implementing
                    occasional breaks to reset and recharge. It's not weak to
                    rest, it's wise.

                    Trying to brute force your way to progress may work in the
                    end, but it will usually produce a worse result on top of
                    costing you significantly more time. Why? Because you're
                    probably trying to rush to the finish line too quickly and
                    force a "win," which shows a lack of patience and respect
                    for the process required to get there. Or you may be
                    thinking, "This is the only way," which closes your mind to
                    better alternative solutions. However, you won't believe how
                    fast great solutions pop up if you simply take a break and
                    let your subconscious mind perform its magic. Try activating
                    divergent thinking in your mind. First, write down what
                    you're struggling with. Then, do something else, think about
                    something else, go for a walk, leave and come back, or relax
                    and do nothing. Try letting your mind go on a journey. Your
                    subconscious mind knows exactly what you need and where to
                    find it. Try letting it do its job. You need only have the
                    courage to let go for a moment.

                    and Demonstrations over Explanations.</span
                  >
                  <br />
                  <p>
                    Explanations are the most confusing and least effective form
                    of communication. From debates to teaching, a far better
                    option is to provide specific examples, experiences,
                    demonstrations, or stories because they contain incredible
                    detail, usefulness, and persuasiveness. A single picture or
                    meme is worth a thousand words, while a symbol is worth a
                    million words (think religious cross, crescent moon, flag,
                    or brand logo). Now imagine the power of a demonstration or
                    story. A story infused with many pictures, symbols, and
                    demonstrations is called a movie.

                  <p>
                    Try seeking mentors, coaches, and role models because they
                    serve as real world demonstrations of excellence in your
                    eyes. But be careful in choosing your mentors, coaches, and
                    role models — as well as the people you surround yourself
                    with — because they all will influence who you become. Truly
                    exceptional role models are called heroes or saints. Try
                    finding your heroes of strength, courage, wisdom,
                    excellence, and love. If you ever feel like giving up,
                    always remember you are never alone. The spirits of your
                    heroes always reside within you. Try calling them forth. Ask
                    for their help, guidance, and motivation. Even better, if
                    you can, try listening to your heroes through audio or
                    videos. Try overlaying music with their motivational message
                    to boost the connection between their suggestions and your
                    soul. Here are some examples:

                    Watch as it unleashes your hidden talent, intelligence,

                    share your light with the world. Make your heroes proud.

                    If someone isn't providing you with any evidence or a
                    specific example and instead just their explanatory words,
                    they may be trying to force their conclusion on you. They
                    may not want you to come to your own conclusion, or they may
                    just be stumbling forward in the right direction, which
                    deserves our compassion. At least they're in the arena
                    trying to move forward while many are not. Nonetheless, try
                    to avoid conversations that are overflowing with
                    abstractions and absent any specific examples, evidence, or
                    reasons. Try paying attention to people's words, as well as
                    their actions. Words make real but Actions make true. Are
                    they practicing what they preach? Are they demonstrating the
                    effectiveness of their words? Try letting your walking do
                    the talking. Show, don't tell.

                    An untested idea can be the most beautiful fraud in the

                    fill in your blind spots, especially from people who
                    vehemently disagree with you — or the idea — because they'll

                    Any person, team, organization, or country devoid of Fun and
                    Laughter is a surefire sign that a totalitarian dictatorship
                    has taken over. When that happens, joy and meaning are
                    crushed and replaced with misery and hopelessness, which are
                    a deadly combination. Try finding the Fun and Laughter in a
                    situation, especially in boring or stressful tasks. In fact,
                    intense grief, sadness, or suffering can often be relieved
                    to some degree by humor and laughter. Try laughing with
                    people, having fun in places, and playing with hobbies. Try
                    enjoying stories, art, games, and music. Even in times of
                    great suffering, motivational music can often provide the
                    luminous light at the end of the tunnel. Here are some
                    examples:

                  <p>
                    No matter how bad a situation gets, we can always make it
                    far worse by not having gratitude. The opposite of gratitude
                    is ungratefulness, envy, and resentment, and resentment is
                    one of the foundational elements of evil. Ungratefulness and
                    resentment hide all of the opportunities and treasures
                    standing right in front of you, regardless of the situation.
                    Many religious faiths have daily prayer habits precisely to
                    practice gratitude. The United States even has an official
                    holiday in November literally called, "Thanksgiving."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    So try being grateful for your current situation. What are
                    you taking for granted right now? That can be hard to figure
                    out sometimes. One way to make it easier is to look at the
                    bad things in other people's lives. For example, some of the
                    most watched and listened to genres of entertainment are
                    tragedy and true crime. What's tragedy and true crime? True
                    and real world examples of bad things in other people's
                    lives. When you see the pain, suffering, and horror that
                    some people have endured — and that some are enduring right
                    now as you read this — it becomes a little easier to
                    recognize the gifts and treasures in your own life.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Finding Gratefulness will enhance your vision and reveal the
                    path toward Hope of a better today, and tomorrow. We can
                    either say "Thank you" or "Goodbye."

                    Assuming a solution is a one-size-fits-all for your problems
                    or goals reveals a deep misunderstanding of who each of us
                    is. We are incredibly and richly unique in every sense of
                    the word. Yes, of course, we all share a lot in common,
                    however, we also hold within us a very unique life and
                    distinct perspective that only we can speak for.

                    The human brain is the most complex entity in the entire
                    universe, and you've been gifted one of your own. The human
                    brain contains about 86 billion neurons forming trillions of
                    constantly-changing connections, governs consciousness and
                    unconscious bodily functions, and still only uses around 20
                    watts of power — or about what a dimly lit lightbulb uses —
                    despite orchestrating everything that we are.

                    So try exploring your uniqueness, interests, and values. How
                    can people respect you if you don't respect yourself? Try
                    showing yourself some respect, compassion, and forgiveness
                    by getting in touch with your innate self-worth. Try having
                    gratitude for the soul you've been given and the body you're
                    responsible for. Your number one job in this world is to
                    take care of yourself so you can more effectively take care
                    of other people. So try taking some time for yourself. You
                    deserve it just as much as anybody else. To ignore our
                    uniqueness is to argue we have no differences, no
                    individuality, and no soul to call our own.

                    Any effort without collaboration will always be and always
                    remain incomplete because we are all unique and two minds
                    are better than one. So I humbly reach out to you with a
                    call for aid. Would you mind providing the final principles
                    so we can build this together? Maybe we can go faster alone,
                    but we can go much further together. For example,

                (examples below). <br />
                Actions are preplanned habits to be executed immediately and

                After a Trigger is identified in the real world, you are
                unauthorized to hesitate, think, or negotiate with yourself
                because your preplanned Action was chosen by you to achieve one
                of your goals and live your values.
                <br />
                Thinking destroys actions and habits. <br />
                So try to avoid thinking. More doing. You'll have plenty of time
                to think and negotiate with yourself during planning and
                preparation.

                The "Trigger > Action" Technique is similar to Task Bracketing
                and also similar to David Goggins' "One Second Decision."

                Authorities and Leaders care about most in the world. <br />
                Only emotions/feelings and people's actions can reveal someone's
                true Values and Fears. Therefore, emotions/feelings and people's
                actions are foundational aspects of — and crucial to — any
                problem solving process. <br />
                Authorities and Leaders want to live their Values and avoid
                their Fears.<br />
                Values elicit positive emotions while Fears elicit negative
                emotions.<br />
                Values and Fears can reveal Goals.<br />
                Values and Fears are two sides of the same coin.
                <br />
                Identify a Value (Strength, Wisdom) and you immediately know the
                associated Fear (Weakness, Stupidity), and vice versa. <br />
                Identify a Value or Fear and ask, "Why this Value/Fear?" Keep
                asking and answering for five times. This step applies the Five
                Whys structured analytic technique to find much deeper and more
                important Core Values and Fears.
                <br />
                Probably the most important Values and Fears are the ones you're
                hiding or avoiding because they contain the greatest insights
                into your true character.

                Goals are also Solutions to Problems.<br />
                Goals can reveal their Solutions and Problems.<br />

                There are two types of Goals: 1) Live a Value, 2) Avoid a Fear.
                <br />
                Goals to avoid our Fears are up to <u>200% more effective</u> at
                driving behavior than Goals to live our Values.
                <br />
                Try combining them: Get in better shape (Value), and Avoid being
                fat (Fear).<br />
                Even better, keep asking and answering "Why this Goal?" until
                you get to answers that strike you with intense emotion. Now
                you've truly found rocket fuel to help you fly toward your
                goals.
                <br />
                Not making progress toward at least one of our Goals or failing
                to live our Values significantly contributes to feelings of
                depression and anxiety.<br />
                We innately need to feel progress toward our Goals or our body
                will start to fire the alarm bells to try to get us back on
                track to achieving our Goals, and living our Values.<br />
                Progress over perfection.<br />
                It's the progress on our journey or quest that matters most, not
                the destination.

                Struggling to solve problems holds us back a great deal at work
                and at home. If we can't solve a problem, it can lead to great
                pain and terrible consequences. I feel I'm not living up to my
                potential and I don't think I'm alone in feeling that way.

                Now that first paragraph sounds reasonable, but it's not the
                full truth. Therefore, it's a lie. As a longtime alcoholic, my
                first intuition is to lie, but as a recovering alcoholic now, my
                intuition is to catch myself lying and correct the lie as soon
                as possible with the truth.

                The truth is I created this website because I destroyed nearly
                everything in my life. I'm divorced and I deserve it. My mission
                now is to try and repay the debt I've incurred to my family,
                friends, and community. I figured one way I could achieve that
                was to create a website that captures everything I've learned
                about problem solving, which is one of the most important skills
                in life, period. A website that can be used anywhere, anytime,
                and by anyone, especially my kids and me.
