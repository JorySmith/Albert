                However, most things in life should be assumed to be false and
                therefore tested in the real world. <br />
                Mother Nature, people's actions, free markets, and your higher
                power are the ultimate judges of truth.
                <br />
                Even if these principles are true and helpful, nobody's perfect
                and nobody can claim perfect adherence to them.
                <br />
                It's better to stumble forward in the right direction than stand
                still chasing perfection.
                <br />
                Progress over perfection.

                    Running away from problems is the greatest problem in the
                    world, which is understandable because it takes true courage
                    to willingly face and take on danger. However, ignoring
                    problems only makes them grow bigger and more dangerous with
                    time.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Solutions are found within the problem they solve. Try
                    becoming antifragile by learning, growing, and thriving from
                    your problems and fears. But be careful of focusing on
                    obvious problems because they're probably symptoms of much
                    deeper and more important problems that need solved. You
                    don't have to dig very deep to find something truly tragic
                    in anyone's life. And it's these deep problems and pains
                    that contain much more impactful solutions and insights.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Try visiting but not remaining in the darkness to find the
                    answers you seek. Especially the scariest problems that
                    undoubtedly contain some serious pain and discomfort but
                    also the most powerful solutions that can help you grow
                    stronger, wiser, and more resilient.

                    Try to avoid the consequences of purposeless nihilism, which
                    is pure hell, and hell is a bottomless pit of problems. In
                    the end, when you look back on your life, how would you feel
                    about it? Would you be able to admire and love yourself?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Nobody's perfect, but try taking responsibility for your
                    life. Try being a better person today than you were
                    yesterday. Are you living in service of others or in selfish
                    slavery to yourself? Who are you accountable to? Having a
                    good aim literally changes your reality and vision. An aim
                    reveals what you actually see in the world. An aim reveals
                    the righteous path you've chosen and the problems and
                    obstacles in your way.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    If you stumble and fail at an obstacle on your path, try to
                    avoid beating yourself up for it because it'll just create
                    five more problems and obstacles in your way. Try dusting
                    yourself off, fixing what went wrong, getting back on the
                    horse, and moving forward. If you're not moving forward and
                    growing, you're dying.

                  <p>
                    Telling lies and trusting lies are a one-way ticket to
                    misery and hell. Lies may not take you to hell immediately,
                    but the destination is certain. It's when, not if. Lies will
                    imprison you, while the truth will set you free. Lies erode
                    trust in relationships and trust is the foundation of all
                    healthy, strong, and deep relationships.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Arrogance and excessive pride precede many downfalls. Why?
                    Because these traits generally indicate someone has become
                    complacent and abandoned the truth. This person probably has
                    a narcissistic conviction that he or she knows the truth
                    above anyone else or reality itself, which is a lie. So try
                    showing humility and gratitude because they are potent
                    antidotes to the toxic and intoxicating feelings of
                    arrogance and excessive pride that destroy the weak, and the
                    strong.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Try telling the truth and only trusting the truth. That can
                    be very difficult, so try not telling lies and not trusting
                    lies. Watch as it leads toward inner peace and greatness.

                    You will not believe how much of your voice is silenced,
                    handcuffed, and locked away in a prison. That is until you
                    try writing for five minutes about your thoughts, worries,
                    frustrations, fears, problems, goals, etc. Anything and
                    everything you can think of. Try writing about the
                    activities where you experience the most meaning. Try
                    writing about what you want and where you want to go,
                    especially your core identity and values. What do you
                    stand for? What are your greatest strengths? Your greatest 
                    strengths tend to be related to your greatest weaknesses. 
                    Just try to get your thoughts out of your mind and onto
                    paper, or talk about them with someone you trust.

                    Writing and talking about anything supercharge clarity,
                    memory, and problem solving skills. Writing and talking
                    bring ephemeral thoughts and abstract ideas into the real
                    world so you can face them. Once you can face thoughts and
                    ideas, you can understand, learn, and grow from them.
                    Writing and talking also free your soul and liberate the
                    value you can bring to the world. Consider sharing,
                    teaching, and sharpening what you've discovered on your
                    writing and talking journey.

                    The foundational goal of mental health therapeutic problem
                    solving is self-awareness through self-exploration,
                    expression, and understanding. Self-awareness necessitates
                    that we write and talk about what we've discovered on our
                    self-exploration journey. Try bringing your unconscious mind
                    into the world through writing and talking to reveal its
                    secrets, tragedies, and treasures. You just might discover a
                    few surprising life-changing miracles.

                    Feeling unmotivated, stuck, emotional, or just wanting to
                    give up? You probably haven't clearly defined your problem
                    or goal in writing, which can make it really difficult to
                    understand and tackle effectively. You might be trying to do
                    too much at a time, brute force a solution that's not
                    working, or comparing your Chapter 2 progress to someone
                    else's Chapter 10, all of which can be incredibly
                    demoralizing. You also might be forgetting to reduce the
                    friction between you and showing up to start progress, such
                    as forgetting to lay out gym clothes the night before a gym
                    session. All of these actions can insidiously implant the
                    feeling that showing up and taking the first step, or just
                    the next step, look way too daunting. So we give up.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Remember, simply showing up is half the battle. In addition,
                    each step you take, whether it's the first, 20th, or last,
                    is a decisive victory and clear proof you can do this. The
                    first step and last step are usually the hardest steps to
                    take. But if you can create the conditions that help you
                    show up, you are already halfway to your goal. Then all you
                    need to do is focus on taking that next step. That next
                    step of victory that proves you can definitely do this and
                    nothing is going to stop you from achieving your goals and
                    living your values.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It's also important to remember we all suck when we start
                    something new. We all face failure and a ton of mistakes,
                    especially at the beginning of any effort, and especially
                    champions because they see mistakes more clearly and feel
                    them more intensely than most. But each step we take is a
                    decisive victory, and we need to try to develop the habit of
                    taking that next step to build countless victories. Try to
                    develop the habit of taking bad options off the table for
                    discussion, like quitting or harmful behaviors, and start
                    focusing on the next good option to take, like one more
                    step in the right direction. Our habits transform us into
                    the people we are so try taking a break to better understand
                    the problem you're trying to solve or the goal you're trying
                    to achieve. Then try breaking it down into smaller tasks
                    that require less energy and motivation to get started or
                    keep going. Try setting shorter timeframe goals to help you
                    accomplish those crucial initial victories or maintain your
                    current victory momentum.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Ask yourself, "What small step am I actually willing to take
                    right now?" Identify this critical small step and then aim
                    for it. Show up to start your journey or get back on the
                    victory path. Watch as your small victories build momentum,
                    grow your victory resume, and ultimately solidify your
                    confidence and conviction. Imagine how you'll feel if you're
                    victorious. Imagine how you'll feel if you fail to start or
                    keep going and let down the people you care about most. You
                    can always make improvements as you iterate. Progress over
                    perfection.

                    You don't have to struggle alone. Two minds are better than
                    one and most problems have already been solved. You need
                    only search for their solutions or ask for help. Asking
                    questions and listening can become some of your most
                    powerful problem solving tools.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It can feel scary asking for help. It can feel like you're
                    exposing yourself as someone who doesn't know what they're
                    doing. However, nobody knows everything and champions rarely
                    rely on just themselves. We also know it usually feels
                    better to give than it is to receive. So try to avoid
                    robbing people of their chance to help you, especially the
                    people you lead. We all want to feel impactful and
                    contribute to the mission. Try enabling that by asking for
                    help when you need it.

                    One of the fastest ways to find the correct solution is to
                    share the wrong solution publicly -- or at least your guess
                    -- and watch as the community feels compelled to correct the
                    error immediately and without hesitation, which is
                    Cunningham's Law.

                    If you want to move slower, undermine outcomes, and degrade
                    relationships, then bossing people around, including bossing
                    yourself around, is a great strategy. Little freedom, low
                    productivity. Being bossed around can make us quite
                    undisciplined and really hurt, and hurt people tend to hurt
                    people, especially themselves.

                    Try to avoid inviting suffering into your life by losing
                    track of the critical things you need to do to achieve your
                    goals and live your values. Try creating schedules, to-do
                    lists, to-don't lists, and timelines as well as setting
                    reminders and deadlines. Try scheduling something to look
                    forward to and watch it generate energy, hope, and optimism.
                    Deadlines help you avoid overworking and analysis paralysis.
                    Deadlines also provide a welcome finish line and turn
                    infinite suffering into finite frustrations.

                    Try to avoid restricting your options at the beginning of
                    any venture because it will only limit your possibilities,
                    degrade performance, and may send you down the wrong path.
                    The opportunity cost of going down the wrong path can be
                    quite costly. Try considering many options initially to
                    maximize the chances of choosing the best direction and most
                    effective action.

                    door because it's quite destructive to brainstorming. Try to
                    express your deepest Curiosity and Creativity. Try writing
                    down as many ideas, possibilities, options, and alternatives
                    as possible. Quantity over quality.

                    Assume Murphy's Law will prevail and that anything that can
                    go wrong, will go wrong. Then try doing a premortem, i.e.,
                    brainstorming future consequences and problems to solve now
                    before they plague you and your team later.

                    Try to avoid wasting time on things that don't matter. Some
                    things are far more important and impactful than other
                    things, also known as the 80/20 Principle, which is derived
                    from the Pareto Principle. Quality over quantity. Try
                    narrowing your focus and attention on the things that matter
                    by filtering, reducing, and setting aside the noise. Less is
                    more. Also, emotions and feelings can reveal what truly
                    matters to you. Try exploring them.

                    progress or results is the definition of insanity and isn't

                    Try activating divergent thinking in your mind. First, write
                    down what you're struggling with. Then, do something else,
                    think about something else, go for a walk, leave and come
                    back, or relax and do nothing. Try letting your mind go on a
                    journey. Your subconscious mind knows exactly what you need
                    and where to find it. Try letting it do its job. You need
                    only have the courage to let go for a moment.

                  <p>
                    Explanations are the least effective form of communication.
                    From debates to teaching, a far better option is to provide
                    specific examples, stories, or demonstrations because they
                    contain incredible detail, usefulness, and persuasiveness. A
                    single picture is worth a thousand words. Imagine the power
                    of a demonstration.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Try seeking mentors and role models, which are real world
                    demonstrations of excellence in your eyes. Be careful who
                    you choose because who you emulate or surround yourself with
                    the most, is who you become. Also, if someone isn't
                    providing you with a specific example, they might be trying to force
                    their conclusion on you instead of allowing you to come to
                    your own conclusion. Try watching people's actions. Are they
                    practicing what they preach? Are they demonstrating the
                    effectiveness of their words? Try letting your walking do
                    the talking. Show, don't tell.

                    Any person, team, organization, or country devoid of Fun and
                    Laughter is a surefire sign that a totalitarian dictatorship
                    has taken over. When that happens, joy and meaning are
                    crushed and replaced with misery and hopelessness, which are
                    a deadly combination. Try finding the Fun and Laughter in a
                    situation, especially in boring or trivial tasks. Try
                    laughing with people, having fun in places, playing with
                    hobbies, and enjoying music and stories. Find the Light in
                    the Darkness. Your community will be thankful you did.

                    The opposite of Gratitude is ungratefulness and resentment,
                    and resentment is one of the foundational elements of evil.
                    Ungratefulness and resentment hide all of the opportunities
                    and treasures standing right in front of you, regardless of
                    the situation. No matter how bad a situation gets, we can
                    always make it far worse by not having gratitude. Try being Grateful for your
                    current situation. Gratefulness will enhance your vision and
                    reveal the path toward Hope of a better today, and tomorrow.
                    We can either say "Thank you" or "Goodbye."

                    Assuming a solution is a one-size-fits-all for your problems
                    or goals reveals a deep misunderstanding of who each of us
                    are. We are incredibly and richly unique in every sense of
                    the word. Yes of course, we all share a lot in common,
                    however, we also hold within us a very unique life and
                    distinct perspective only we can speak for. Try exploring
                    your uniqueness, interests, and values. Try showing some
                    respect for yourself. To ignore our uniqueness is to argue
                    we have no differences, no individuality, and no soul to
                    call our own.

                    Any effort without collaboration will always be and always
                    remain incomplete because we are all unique and two minds
                    are better than one. So I humbly reach out to you with a
                    call for aid. Would you mind providing the final principle
                    so we can build this together? Maybe we can go faster alone,
                    but we can go much further together.

                to take Action. <br />
                Trigger > Action. <br />
                Triggers fall into three categories: Time, Event, and Visual Cue
                (examples below). <br />
                Actions are preplanned habits to be executed immediately and
                without hesitation or thinking, once a Trigger is identified.
                <br />
                After a Trigger is identified in the real world, you are
                unauthorized to negotiate with yourself or take time to decide
                what to do because your preplanned Action was chosen by you to
                help you achieve your goals and live your values.
                <br />
                The only authorized time to negotiate with yourself over what to
                do after a Trigger is observed is during preparation and
                planning.
                <br />
                The "Trigger > Action" Technique may also be referred to as Task
                Bracketing and is also similar to David Goggins' "One Second
                Decision."

                Values and Fears -- or Standards and Worries -- are what
                Authorities and Leaders care about most in the world. <br />
                Only emotions and actions can reveal someone's true Values and
                Fears. Therefore, emotions and actions are foundational aspects
                of -- and crucial to -- any problem solving process. <br />
                When someone makes a decision based on deep emotions and
                feelings, they often describe it as following their gut or
                heart. I think technically it's localized to the brain's limbic
                system, but I'm not a neuroscientist.<br />
                Values elicit positive emotions while Fears elicit negative
                emotions.<br />
                Values and Fears can reveal Goals.<br />
                Values and Fears are two sides of the same coin.
                <br />
                Identify a Value (Strength, Wisdom) and you immediately know the
                associated Fear (Weakness, Stupidity), and vice versa. <br />
                Identify a Value or Fear, ask, "Why this Value/Fear?" Keep
                asking and answering for five times and you'll typically arrive
                at a truly Core Value or Fear.<br />
                Probably the most important Values and Fears are the ones you're
                hiding or avoiding because they contain the greatest insights
                into your true character.

                Goals are also Solutions to Problems.<br />
                Goals can reveal their Solutions and Problems.<br />

                There are two types of Goals: 1) Live/Achieve a Value, 2) Avoid a Fear. <br />
                Goals to avoid Fears are <u>100-200%</u> more effective at
                driving behavior than Goals to achieve Values.
                <br />
                Try combining them: Get in better shape and Avoid being fat.<br />
                Can you feel the difference? It sure isn't fun to hear but we
                can either take the less painful way toward our Goals, or the
                more effective way.<br />
                Progress over perfection.<br />
                Not making progress toward at least one of our Goals or failing
                to live our Values significantly contributes to feelings of
                depression and anxiety.<br />
                We innately need to feel progress toward our Goals or our body
                will start to fire the alarm bells to try to get us back on
                track to living our Values.<br />
                It's the journey that matters most, not the destination.

              <p>
                Struggling to solve problems holds us back a great deal at work
                and at home. If we can't solve a problem, it can lead to great
                pain and terrible consequences. I feel I'm not living up to my
                potential and I don't think I'm alone in feeling that way.
              </p>
              <p>
                Now that first paragraph sounds reasonable but it's not the full
                truth. Therefore, it's a lie. As a longtime alcoholic, my first
                intuition is to lie but as a recovering alcoholic now, my
                intuition is to catch myself lying and correct the lie as soon
                as possible with the truth.
              </p>
              <p>
                The truth is I created this website because I destroyed nearly
                everything in my life. I'm divorced and I deserve it. It's in
                this hell that I realized I had a choice, a choice to either
                stop running away from my problems and start facing them or
                continue on the path to self-destruction and armageddon. And
                I've chosen the former and hopefully my actions will prove it.
              </p>
              <p>
                My mission now is to stop running away from my problems and try
                to repay the debt I've incurred to my family, friends, and
                community. I figured one way I could achieve that was to create
                a website that captures everything I've learned about problem
                solving. A website that anyone, especially my kids and I, can
                use anywhere, anytime.
